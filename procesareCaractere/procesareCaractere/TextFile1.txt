A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of class.
Let's assume we have a class named Fruit. A Fruit can have properties like name,
color, weight, etc. We can define variables like name, color and weight to hold the values of these properties.
When the individual objects, apple, banana etc. are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors 
from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.
